# Evaluating-COVID-19-Severity-Based-on-Regions

For this project, I wanted to see if COVID-19 severity varies by regions, especially continents. I used a dataset from WHO to obtain each country's vaccination status along with a COVID-19 dataset from Worldometer. These data points are taken at the beginning of 2021; therefore, analysis might be irrelevant now. The datasets obtained only display a small section in time compared to the overall time of the pandemic.
